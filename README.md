# sass-u



"U" = my utilities, but also my learnings ðŸ˜‰ ...use at own risk.

```sh
# in terminal, in project dir
npm install --save @lunelson/sass-u

# ...and the peerDependency ;)
npm install --save @lunelson/sass-throw
```
```scss
// in sass file, assuming 'node_modules' is in Sass' search path
@import '@lunelson/sass-throw/index';
@import '@lunelson/sass-u/index';
```
